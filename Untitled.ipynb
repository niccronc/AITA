T has a background with dogs in this house - I've been told she had a border collie puppy whom she kept outside without shelter, which was taken away by the council for howling constantly. This all happened before I moved in. She is of the opinion that dogs should be outside, but she agreed when I moved in that my dog was an inside dog.\n",

I also have recently discovered, T has a habit of leaving food on her floor. Generally, I watch my dog whenever he is free in the house, and he stays in my room when I'm out. I admit that there are times I've left my door open while studying and kept an ear out, but he's never been destructive or much of a nuisance so I thought all was well. I also assumed that by leaving the door open, my flatmate didn't have anything dangerous in her room. \n",

She said this had been an ongoing issue and that he'd been pushing his way in, and that I needed to stop him from going in. My thought process is that if she refuses to shut her door, she needs to accept that my dog can get in there and not leave dangerous food on the floor, at least until I can work with him on boundary training at her door.

We were talking a few months ago and I asked her if my mom cheated on my dad and she didn’t say yes directly but she basically confirmed it. If she didn’t cheat it wasn’t anything better, that’s all I know.

Nothing came of it. Joe and I became good friends, and I became privy to a lot of personal details about him. He’s a vet with PTSD, an alcohol abuse problem and the tendency to cheat on every girl he’s ever dated. He and I no longer have any contact for a number of reasons, all to do with his shitty behavior. \n",

I didn’t share the more personal details as those are his stories to tell, simply shared that he can’t keep it in his pants and he’s not as great to date as she fantasizes he would be.

I had switched off all appliances the night before we went away, but in the morning she decided she wanted to quickly make some scrambled eggs and got the cooker going. She left the gas fire on and since I was loading the boot up with luggage I asked her ‘did you remember to turn everything off’ when she came back down and she said yes. I needed a last minute wee and decided to check everything again just for peace of mind before locking up when I realised the stove had been left on.

All the claims I made are rebutted with completely conflicting evidence that doesn’t line up at all with the multiple sources I’ve seen. I start getting mad because he’s calling me out over and over saying the points I bring up aren’t valid and that the people I watch are just looking for reasons to hate the show because of “nostalgia boners.” At this point, I’ve given up trying to argue for myself so I send him one of the sources I refer to, and he refuses to look at it because he’s not interested.

I was also extremely angry so I took the screenshots, posted them on my social media and have been getting messages from more people telling me they knew she did this but didn’t want to get involved. I’ve had a few people tell me I’m an asshole because I should just let it go but the thing is she’s telling people I was toxic/manipulative when all I did was pay for her things, get her a job, ditch my friends for her.

      "\n",
      "We have weight training three days a week and Louise and I always share a bench, which is usually ok. The thing is that Louise is very very slow. When you share a bench, you also share equipment, so if Louise is still working through one exercise, I can't start my next set until she's done. This was fine when we didn't have timed workouts. I would wait for her to finish and then I'd do my sets. I might have to stay 5 minutes late, but it was worth it to be with my friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing is that we've just started doing timed workouts, where you have 20 minutes to complete as many circuits as you can and you are expected to either lift heavier or finish faster every time you lift. The problem is that Louise slows me down, so I'm in danger of not hitting my numbers while she's slowly finishing up with the equipment I need. She could be faster, but she insists on matching the weights I'm doing, so if I do an exercise with 20 lb weights, she isn't really ok with using the 15 lb weights. Our weight training partners are still kind of flexible but honestly, there isn't really anyone as slow as Louise. I don't know who she'd go with if I weren't her partner and we're friends so I don't want to leave her but at the same time, I don't want to get in trouble for being so slow.\n",

He (being the manipulative sociopathic person that he is) has spun a whole web of lies about me to all the people who knew us as a couple, leaving out every terrible thing he ever did and placing all blame on me.

      " Late last year after my sister (15) started Year 10 at school, Dean - someone that I'd known from the year before when I finished and moved onto an apprenticeship (working and education for non-UK connasseurs) started flirting with her in a rather one-sided conversation and eventually sent her dick pics and other nudes. She didn't like this and eventually came to me with these photos because it was making her really uncomfortable after which I spoke to Dean on messenger telling him to leave her alone. Instead of apologising he ran his mouth at me, tried to act like a keyboard hardman - so I got my sister to forward screenshots of the nudes/dick pics Dean sent (with his name tagged on them from messenger) backed them up to various secure places then passed them onto Dean warning him that if he didn't leave her alone I'd make it public that he was pestering a younger girl who wasn't interested in him and leaves printed copies of the nudes outside my old school (where he was still in sixth form, my sister was 2 years below him in y10). The threat of public humiliation seemed to work as he apologised then cut off contact and my sister didn't hear anything from him for a while.\n",

So I started chatting with her and slowly, we started spending more and more time together and then we started dating in secret at first, we didn't want to tell anyone until we were sure it's not just a fling, after a month or so, we decided to tell all our friends but in a nice way, we wanted to suprise them becouse it's all good news.

Then a week or so later my gf came home and said that he confronted her in the mall and told her that she rushed into this, that she needs to beware of who I am, and that she's making a mistake.

Now I couldn't tolerate this any longer and I gave him a call and asked him what's up trying really hard to stay polite, he then told me that this was completely unacceptable of me, dating his best friend, and that it's her fault too choosing me over their friendship that it's like I'm dating his sister again, and that we are no longer friends.

I go home to my parent's lake house 2-3 times a year, and if my family and their direct neighbors are not home, I will usually go outside naked starting around dusk, having a nice naked bonfire or sitting on the dock in the dark.  My parents are aware that I do this and have no issue with it - and I warn them if the deer-sighting camera goes off unexpectedly so they can delete the evidence.\n",

I brought a chair and a book out to the firepit, lit a fire, and reclined in the sun.  The house is on a semi-private lake (public boat access, no public beaches, no-wake rule so only fishing boats really) and is located in a small bay.  There are 4 houses in the bay; ours is the third one in.  There are only two spots in the yard you can really see the lake right now because of the trees - directly off the dock, and a clearing about 6 feet wide that points out to the main lake.  The bay is shallow and full of weeds; in 10 years, I've only ever seen one person fishing in it.  The area across from the houses is marshy and uninhabited.  The clearing is small enough and the bay is remote enough that I assumed people wouldn't see me - you're usually not looking onto the shore when you're fishing.  \n",

At that time the boat was no longer there.  About 20 minutes later, I heard a motor and looked, and the same boat was back in the clearing - far enough out that I couldn't see faces but close enough that I could tell there were 2 middle-age men in the boat.  I drifted back to sleep.  A short time later, I heard the 'klunk' of something hitting my dock, so I sat up confused and grabbed my towel.  \n",

They said it was illegal for me to be naked outside; I said no, I'm on my own private property, and our state doesn't have rules against it anyway.  They said they found it distracting while they were fishing, I said sorry but that's not my fault, and they said they were going to report me to the DNR for interfering with their fishing.  I shrugged and said sorry, hope you have a better day, and out of politeness gathered my things and went inside.  They boated away and I haven't seen them on the lake since.\n",

      " 3 years ago, my adoptive mom helped me buy a house with my inheritance from when my adoptive dad passed away.  I was told by her that this was my inheritance and that when I was ready to sell it and move somewhere else she would be fine with it. Now she is listed as the secondary owner just in case anything happened to me.  So she has to sign off on anything to do with selling the house unfortunately. Recently I decided it was time for me to move on with my life and sell the house so my fiancee and I can buy our first house together.  He's putting just as much into this as I am but my mom has done nothing but throw roadblocks in our plans. At first she was refusing to sign but after several conversations signed the papers to list the house. At this point she was saying it was her money and not my inheritance like she originally said. As the primary owner the money from the house will go to me though. Today I approved an offer for the house and now need her to sign more papers confirming the sale before the final closing paperwork. When I called to let her know, she said I can't have all the money from the sale. She's saying I can only have about half. I'm upset about the whole thing because we had plans for every bit of the money we get from the sale. Every time I talk to her she acts like I owe her for taking me in as a child. Am I the asshole for wanting to sell the house and keep all the money?\n",

      " Sorry for any poor grammar or any rule breaking this is my first post. Alright lets get into it! So when I was 11-13 my parents were heavy alcoholics and my Dad was homeless. My Mom and my stepdad would get physically and mentally abusive (I could elaborate but I don't feel comfortable doing so on the internet). It ended for the most part after the second time I called the police and my stepdad got arrested. Afterward my mom drank heavy and shamed me for about a week. The new problem arose when my stepdad got released. He was on house arrest and wasn't allowed to have contact with us for a month. My mom decided it would be a great idea to take us to visit him two days after he was placed on house arrest (he was only in jail for 10 days).I was uncomfortable with the interaction and tried to walk home but I felt like my mom forced me to stay. My stepdad was perky and uncomfortably happy. His initial response to me calling was positive but slowly after he started poking fun and shaming me. I brought up how fast we were interacting to our social worker and the interaction went something like this:\n",
      "( social worker was asking about our relationship )\n",

My stepdad and I are always back and forth over stupid things such as me messing up while making coffee ( filter broke and grounds got into the pot ). I try to explain to my mom why I am sad and she essentially says \"Oh I understand my mom did etc.\". I don't know if it's her trying to relate to me but I'm trying to discuss current issues that are plaguing my life. Then I try to explain to my stepdad why I don't trust him and my problems with his tone and comments. He gets angry and then I bring up his previous actions that I remember. He gets uncomfortable and says he doesn't remember doing those things and asks me to quit talking about them as they hurt his feelings. I just want him to understand three things\n",

Every single time he is out here with his dog he abuses them. He shoves, he pushes, and he verbally assaults his dog. He will kick the fence and scream/yell for him to come. Ignoring the fact that he never even goes into the dog park to pick up after his dog as well, he is just an absolute nightmare to listen to. I hear and see him yelling, and dragging, and yanking his dog every freaking time. All the while he is on his phone screeching to whoever the fuck is his friend. I got so fed up, that today after he yanked his dog out of the park, with a loud yelp from the dog with his tail between his legs mind you, that I walked to the front of the building and watched which other apartment (out of 8) that he walked into. I have no idea how to go about reporting him to anyone, even if I speak to management he is a minor and I don't know who he even is, all I know is the building he is in which has 8 different families/apartments in it. \n",

I had my life planned out from doing until year 2 of highschool here and doing the rest in Australia to do uni there and join the army but the News of moving to a new continent and leaving everyone I know behind including one of my cats that I am unseparable from since he pratically comforts me and reduces my anxiety left me angry since Whenever I try to argue about it my parents Just laugh it off and say I'll change my mind when I go there. So WIBTA if I continue arguing against them or should think about my dads job situation?\n",

      " Long story short me and my fiance' frequently go to our local  LGBT center where they host a monthly transgender initiative. The event used to be lead by someone who allowed cis people to attend as long as a trans person invited them. At the start of  the year someone new took over the group and unbeknownst to both of us, cis people are not allowed to attend these meetings under any circumstances. I was frankly suprised since I was pretty much silent during the entire meeting.\n",

      " So I have known this person for basically my whole life. We have been best friends through elementary up until now. The past 8 years my friend has struggled with depression, alcoholism, and other general destructive behaviors. His bed is a mountain of empty whiskey bottles and his room has about 65 empty pizza boxes ( thats the only thing he will eat). He is not the same person that was my friend but a shell of a person.  Me and his close friends have tried everything we can think of... tried to get him to go to therapy and A.A, talked to him, tough love, sitting down with him and explaining how his behavior hurts us, trying to get him to do anything that would improve his situation. None of it has made a scratch and the problem has only persisted ( maybe even gotten worse ). Recently me and a friend talked to his parents and told them that he was in a bad place, leaving out the massive amount of alcohol he consumes. They spent the next couple of weeks paying more attention to him, calling him more often, and coming to see him ( we both moved away from our hometown ). He has always been good at playing things off so of course after their \"thorough investigation \" they both concluded that he was just in a rut and would come out of it. I would agree with them but i have lived with him over the last 5 years ( mostly because Im scared of what will happen when he is alone) and I know its not a rut. Its something he needs serious help with and if its not soon I'm afraid he will drink himself to death. So i want to know WIBTA if i took a picture of his room and sent it to his parents for them to truly see what he has become?\n",

We split up about 3 months after this happened and the breakup was messy, I basically kicked her out of the apartment after giving a couple of weeks to pack her belongings. She had a kid, no job, and had to find a place to live, so I figured I would at least let her keep the car until she got back on her feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a few months she got a job and started paying me back for the monthly payments on the lease. This worked pretty well for about a year. About 3-4 months ago she stopped paying me and said she was struggling financially. I figured it wouldnt take long for her to get back on track, but I've sent her multiple messages to seek payments and she has been either saying she needs more time or doesnt respond. Given knowledge of her behavior and personality, I'm positive she has no intentions of paying for the car and is hoping I'm too lazy and nonconfrontational to do anything about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've decided I'm ready to get my car back so I can sell it and use some of my money to pay off the lease. She has the only copy of the keys, so I will go to the dealership I purchased the car at and have another copy of the keys made. After this I will probably show up in the middle of the night to her neighborhood and use the keys to unlock the car and drive out of her driveway. I would leave any bulky items in front the house and drive off.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point I'm ready to cut the ex out so I can move on with my life. Obviously losing the car would be a big deal for the ex as it's her main mode of transportation and would affect if she needs to take her child anywhere or get to work. However she has made no effort to obtain a cheaper car and return mine so this is my only option. Since I had lent her the car willingly I dont think this would qualify as a stolen vehicle and police wont get involved in civil matters. Also the car is worth more than 10k, so this is beyond the scope of small claims court and I have no interest in the headache of taking this to civil court.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once I have the car I was hoping to block my ex's number and other social media accounts. I would send her a brief message that I would return the rest of her belongings on my way to work the very next day or the day after, and then block her again. The only thing I can think of is if I dont say anything initially, she will obviously freak out and may think the car has been stolen (I doubt she would make the leap of logic that I had spare keys made or would tow the car myself), and I dont know how mean it would be to let her freak out about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "WIBTA for taking the car and then blocking her afterwards, only sending a message a couple of hours or maybe more later to say I took the car and will return belongings in the future?\n",
      "\tsentence  9 :  AITA for getting mad at my friend for not letting a stranger in his car? \n",
      " Disclaimer: this happened during January or February, back when we had record low temperatures from the polar vortex.\n",
      "\n",
      "So my friend invited me over to his dorm to cook with him, he picked me up because he lives on the opposite side of campus. and even with layers of jackets walking outside was literally a nightmare because it was like -15 out and we had CRAZY high winds. after we parked we had to walk for 4 minutes to get to his dorm and when i got to his dorm i felt like i was freeze dried. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he drove me back, I noticed a guy walking from the off-campus apartments to another area on campus which would of been a 12-15 minute walk outside, he didn’t look like he had a lot of money and wasn’t wearing a jacket or any gear to keep warm, he was only wearing jeans and a hoodie and some sneakers. he literally could lose his limbs from the temperature. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ask my friend if he could offer him a ride and he goes “no, i’m not letting a stranger in my car” I tell him, “please he could die from the temperature” and my friend goes “i’m not letting a stranger in my car, he’s dumb for going out like that” and he literally drove away. Is my friend in the right or am i the asshole for pressuring him?\n",
      "\tsentence  10 :  AITA For considering not giving my daughter money for her surgeries. \n",
      " Throwaway\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife and I are considered lower middle class and have three children 24,16 and 11. Three years ago, our oldest came out to us as transgender. We told her we would help in any way to ease her transition. She said she had everything covered since she already finished school, moved out of our home, working a decent job and had considerable savings. She had already spoken to her insurance company about coverage, seen a doctor about starting HRT and was seeing a therapist. I felt she had things in order, but my wife had the foresight to start putting money aside for my daughter, so we could help reduce any future costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two years ago, my daughter moved to a more friendly LGBTQ+ city for better job opportunities and to have a more expanded community. Last year, she opened a second Instagram account and would post about expensive trips she was taking with her boyfriend and friends. My wife and I grew suspicious and asked about how she was paying for the trips. She explained she saved for the trips and her boyfriend was helping to pay. Since she is an adult, we didn’t dig deeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "A week ago, my daughter came home for my 50th birthday and told us that she was ready to start scheduling her surgeries. Insurance will cover bottom surgery. However certain ones like, breast augmentation and surgery to gain a feminine face and body are considered cosmetic and are not covered.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked about how she attended to pay for these, she said that she wanted us to pay for everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife told her about the money that was set aside which amounts to about $4000. My daughter said she needed over $40 grand for the surgeries and possibly more to cover her living expenses, since she won’t be working while she recovers. We asked about the money she saved. She lied and said it wasn’t enough. When pushed more, she broke down and admitted that she had no more saving and that she was in debt. The city she moved to had a higher cost of living then she expected, plus the trips she took were financed by her savings, credit cards and payday loans.\n",
      "\n",
      "I told her we were not in a position to give her $40 grand, but the money that was saved could go towards her debt. She cried and reiterated she needed the full $40 grand or she would never be a real woman. My wife and I tried to come up with reasonable solutions, but my daughter kept insisting for the full amount. At some point, my wife told her that she was being selfish for not thinking about her siblings who still need our support. The two argued and my daughter eventually stormed out of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I’m at a crossroads, I am considering getting a second job to help my daughter and so she doesn’t do anything she’ll regret, but then again, I feel that she needs to learn my wife and I can’t fix everything. AITA\n",
      "\n",
      " **Edit: Thank you for the comments. I talked to my wife and showed her this post. We agreed that I won’t get a second job.** **We are going take some of the suggestions given and speak with our daughter about a solution**\n",
      "\tsentence  11 :  AITA Selling my roommates car? \n",
      " AITHA for selling my roommates car and keeping the money. So my ex roommate is from Spain. He left the country and tried to get back in and they denied him entry because he overstayed his stay in the US. He was on a tourist visa. He left his dog, car and all of his belongings. I have taken care of his dog since December. I also have a dog. He has only sent $50 since. I have taken her to the vet because of fleas, a handful of baths and always has the best food, toys and snacks. I am moving at the end of the month and the pet deposit is $500 per dog. He gave me permission to sell the car in his name, but he is asking too much. I am selling it for below the Kbb value at $1200. I think its only fair that I keep the money. And also rent for the dog is $25 per dog.\n",
      "\tsentence  12 :  WIBTA if I leave my dad without a car 30 minutes from home because he is giving blood? \n",
      " So, this is more for the rest of my family then myself but here we go. \n",
      "At the start of the week my dad decided he would be giving blood. He didn’t say where and he mentioned when but in broad strokes like “at the end of the week” \n",
      "Today I (and the rest of the driving members of my family) receive a call from my dad asking us to drive to a town thirty minutes away to pick him up. \n",
      "While this is certainly an inconvenience, especially since my sister is back in town for all of 2 days and we are spending that time driving we decide to help him out. \n",
      "Upon arriving, we discover that he is only just starting the process and then he ghosts us as we drive around looking for him/ a location to eat. As we approached the hour mark of this journey the discussion turned to just driving home and leaving my dad to his own devices. \n",
      "So, the question is this, would we be dicks for leaving someone that was inconsiderate even when we chose to make the drive?\n",
      "\tsentence  13 :  WIBTA for asking my roommate to pay for parking? \n",
      " Hi this is my first post— sorry for any mistakes and if this post is a bit milder of a question than some of the others on here. \n",
      "\n",
      "Background: So my roommate and I attend a college where theres a popular downtown area nearby with metered parking. We go down there a lot and I’ve always driven because her car is parked a fifteen minute walk away and mine is right outside our dorm. I don’t mind driving and usually just assume I will be because she never really offers. \n",
      "\n",
      "I always use my own debit card to pay the meters when we go into town and it’s starting to add up as it costs about $3-$5 per trip. I’m getting increasingly frustrated that on top of driving I’m also always paying the meter. WIBTA if I ask her to pay a few times even though it’s not her car that’s being parked? I hate confrontation and hopefully you guys have some advice one whether or not this id a good idea. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: WIBTA if I ask my roommate to pay to park my car at a meter if I always drive and always pay?\n"
